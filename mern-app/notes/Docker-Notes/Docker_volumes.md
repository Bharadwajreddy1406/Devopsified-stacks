The line

```yaml
volumes:
  - mongo-data:/data/db
```

creates a binding between a Docker-managed named volume (`mongo-data`) and a directory (`/data/db`) inside the container. Essentially, 

**MongoDB** typically stores its data in the `/data/db` directory, but by using this mapping, you’re instructing Docker to store that data in the managed volume instead of directly inside the container’s filesystem. This ensures that even if the container is removed or recreated, your data persists in the volume. Here’s a granular explanation of how this works:

### 1. Named Volume vs. Bind Mount

- **Named Volume:**  
    `mongo-data` is a named volume managed by Docker independently of any container’s lifecycle. Docker stores these volumes in a default location on the host (typically under `/var/lib/docker/volumes`), ensuring that data persists even if the container is removed.
    
- **Bind Mount (for contrast):**  
    Instead of using a named volume, you could directly bind a specific directory from your host machine to the container. With bind mounts, you manually specify the host directory, whereas with named volumes, Docker handles the storage location.
    

### 2. Mapping Syntax

- **Source:** `mongo-data`  
    This is the name of the volume. If it doesn’t already exist when the container starts, Docker will automatically create it.
    
- **Target:** `/data/db`  
    This is the directory inside the container where the volume is mounted. For MongoDB, this is the default location where it stores its database files.
    

### 3. How Data is Handled

- **Persistence:**  
    When MongoDB writes data to `/data/db` inside the container, those files are actually stored in the `mongo-data` volume. This means that if the MongoDB container is stopped, removed, or updated, the data remains safe in the named volume.
    
- **Data Sharing:**  
    If another container were to mount the same named volume, it would have access to the same data stored in `mongo-data`. This can be useful for sharing data between containers.
    
- **Custom Storage Location:**  
    As you noted, MongoDB typically stores its data in the `/data/db` directory. By mapping that directory to a Docker-managed volume, you're effectively instructing Docker to store the data in the volume instead of keeping it solely inside the container's filesystem. This ensures data durability and makes it easier to manage backups and migrations.
    

### 4. Lifecycle of the Volume

- **Creation:**  
    When you run `docker-compose up` (or a similar command) and the volume `mongo-data` doesn't already exist, Docker will create it automatically.
    
- **Usage:**  
    The MongoDB container uses this volume to store all its database data. Every read/write operation that MongoDB performs on `/data/db` is actually operating on the data stored in `mongo-data`.
    
- **Removal:**  
    Docker volumes are not automatically removed when you take down your containers. If you want to clean up the data, you need to explicitly remove the volume (for example, using `docker volume rm`).
    

### 5. Advantages of Using a Named Volume

- **Data Durability:**  
    Your database data will survive container restarts, upgrades, and even complete removal of the container because it is stored separately in a volume.
    
- **Portability and Manageability:**  
    Docker abstracts away the underlying file system details. You don’t need to worry about the physical location of your data on the host system.
    
- **Simplified Backups:**  
    You can back up the volume without having to access the container’s internal file system directly.
    

### Summary

- **Declaration:**  
    The `volumes:` section at the bottom of the Docker Compose file declares the named volume `mongo-data`.
    
- **Mapping:**  
    The syntax `mongo-data:/data/db` tells Docker to mount this named volume into the container at the `/data/db` path, effectively redirecting where MongoDB stores its data.
    
- **Persistence & Data Management:**  
    This setup ensures that MongoDB’s data persists across container restarts and removals, as it is managed independently by Docker.
    

This detailed explanation should give you a clear understanding of how the volume mapping works and why it is used to ensure data persistence in your MongoDB service.
