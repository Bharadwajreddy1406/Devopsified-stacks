in client side the docker init will work if you are trying out app in development, but on production, 

do the build and serve the files via nginx.

when you do docker init it will give you the compose file and docker file, but instead of that i would prefer using dockerfile and compose file in the client side from here.

i just need to do docker compose up --build then it'll cook the website for me.

When you run:
```bash 

docker run -p 80:80 client

```
Docker maps port 80 on your host to port 80 inside the container. The container is configured (via the `EXPOSE 80` directive) to listen on port 80, and Docker forwards traffic from your host's port 80 to the container's port 80.

but to understand this ,

When you run a command like:
``` shell

docker run -p 5173:80 client

```

it tells Docker to map port 80 inside the container (where Nginx listens) to port 5173 on your host machine. This means that if you access [http://localhost:5173](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/reddy/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-sandbox/workbench/workbench.html) on your browser, you're reaching Nginx running inside the container on port 80.

The port mapping syntax is in the format `HOST:CONTAINER`. it's from left to right.
